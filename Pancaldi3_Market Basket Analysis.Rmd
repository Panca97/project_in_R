Association rules is an unsupervised learning technique which aims to describe and discover regularities between items in transaction data.

It is often used in **basket analysis** in sales to check if there are some general patterns in customers behaviour.

> If customer buys X, he also tends to buy Y

This is the statement that advice the sale department to improve knowledge of customers’ behavior.

The **main goal** of this analysis is to perform most common algorithm used to observe interesting patterns between consumer’s purchases.

# Dataset

The data used in this project contains information about Customers buying different **grocery items** at a Mall and you can find it on kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/roshansharma/market-basket-optimization/version/1.

As the summary output shows, there are **7500 transactions and 119 products**.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
data<- read.transactions("Market_Basket_Optimisation.csv",
                         format = "basket", sep = ",", header = T)
summary(data)
```

The output above anticipates already the most frequent items present in the data, let's try to present them on graph.

```{r echo=FALSE}
itemFrequencyPlot(data, topN = 15, type = "absolute", main = "15 Item frequency", cex.names = 0.9, col= rainbow(15))
```

# Association rules

## Apriori 

First of all, I have to create the rules using **Apriori Algorithm**.

There are three main indicators used to assess the quality of rules:

1. `Support`
2. `Confidence`
3. `lift`

In order to obtain any results to analysis the confidence had to be lowered, I decided to lower their values to **0.01 (support)** and **0.4 (confidence)**.

**17 rules were found.**

```{r}
rules = apriori(data, parameter = list(supp = 0.01, conf = 0.4))
```

### Visualization of rules 

```{r echo=FALSE}
plot(rules, method="paracoord", control=list(reorder=TRUE))
```

## Support

`Support` is the number of times a certain group of items appears in all orders, in other words, it is the **probability of appearing a transaction with all** items together.

$$Support(x) = \frac{Count(x)}{N}$$
where x represents an item and N represents the total number of transactions.

Analysing the most frequent rules by support (around 2.5%):

* 307 transactions on total, contained **ground beef and mineral water**.

```{r}
rules_support = sort(rules, by = "support", decreasing = TRUE)
inspect(head(rules_support))
```

## Confidence

`Confidence` indicates the power of the rule, how often given rule is true.

It has maximum value of 1 and it is when customers **always buy item B with item A**.

$$Confidence(x -> y) = \frac{Support(x,y)}{Support(x)}$$
It is calculated as the support of item x and y divided by the support of item x.


```{r}
rules_confidence = sort(rules, by = "confidence", decreasing = TRUE)
inspect(head(rules_confidence))
```

## Lift

`Lift` can be seen as a measure of correlation of sorts and it is the indicator of **how strong the items are linked**.

* Lift > 1  -> products are positively correlated 
* Lift < 1 -> products are negatively correlated
* Lift = 1 -> products are independent

It can be also defined as a measure of how much more likely one item is to be purchased relative to its typical purchase rate, given that you know another item has been purchased.

$$Lift(x -> y) = \frac{Confidence(x -> y)}{Support(y)}$$

In this case, it is more probable that a customer buys **ground beef, mineral water and spaghetti together** than just these products alone.

```{r}
rules_lift = sort(rules, by = "lift", decreasing = TRUE)
inspect(head(rules_lift))
```

# Spaghetti rules 

![](image/spaghetti.jpg)


In order to go in depth with my analysis, I decided to concentrate my focus on a tipically product of my Italian country: `Spaghetti`.

In other word, I want to find out what products usually are bought together with the **famous type of pasta**.

The output below shows that most **strong rule** is the combination `frozen vegetables`,`olive oil`,`tomatoes` and `spaghetti`.

We can say that a combination of pasta taste has been identified.

It has the highest lift <- `4.835980`.

On other hand, **33 transactions** on total, contained **olive oil, tomatoes and spaghetti**.

```{r}
rules_spaghetti = apriori(data,
    parameter = list(supp = 0.002, conf = 0.6),
    appearance = list(default = "lhs", rhs = "spaghetti"),
    control = list(verbose = F)
  )
inspect(rules_spaghetti, linebreak = FALSE)
```

## Visualization of Spaghetti rules

Let's try to plot the 10 rules created above.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
plot(rules_spaghetti, method="graph", cex=0.7)
plot(rules_spaghetti, method="paracoord", cex=0.7)
```

# Conclusion 

In addition to the basic measures (support, confidence, lift) there are also **different measures** that can be conducted to get the deep knowledge of data:

* Jaccard Index
* Affinity measure

Those two measures will be calculated on the more frequent items.

## Dissimilarity

The possibility of calculating the dissimilarity of items using the **Jaccard index** still exists and it is based on probability calcus.

Checking the product dissimilarity, the most dissimilar products are `chocolate` and `green tea`, `green tea` and `milk` and `french fries` with `milk`.

```{r}
df<-data[,itemFrequency(data)>0.1]
J_index<-dissimilarity(df, which="items") 
round(J_index,digits=3)
```

```{r}
plot(hclust(J_index, method = "ward.D2"), main = "Dendrogram for items")
```

## Similarity 

On the contrary to Jaccard Index, let’s use **Affinity measure** in order to discover similarity of items.

The **least probable itemset** contains `french fries` and `milk`.

```{r}
sim<-affinity(df)
round(sim, digits = 4)
```
